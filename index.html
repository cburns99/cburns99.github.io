      <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>I am a Computer Science major at Oregon State Cascades in Bend Oregon. Over the last few months I have learned and grown significantly. I am truely excited about my future in pursuing Computer Science. I like to think of the journey as being similar to climbing a mountain. Although it is tough, every step towards the summit the view gets a little better. And I would love to be able to reach that summit while growing and learning with other people who are intrested in innovating and improving this world. </p>
